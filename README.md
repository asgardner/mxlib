This is the c/c++ library of Jared Males. 

It contains code I have developed for data analysis and other tasks, primarily related to astronomy.  

The documentation is located here: https://jaredmales.github.io/mxlib/

See the User's Guide for installation instructions.

NOTE:
On 2017-07-08 I moved from bitbucket to github.  To follow along, issue these commands:
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jaredmales/mxlib.git
  git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/jaredmales/mxlib.git
