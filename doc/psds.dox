The mxlib PSD utilities are based on the variance normalization for PSDs.  For a 1-sided 1-dimensional PSD that is
\f[
\sigma^2 = \int_0^{f_{max}} PSD(f) df
\f]
or for a 2-sided 1-D PSD 
\f[
\sigma^2 = \int_{f_{min}}^{f_{max}} PSD(f) df.
\f]
More generally 
\f[
\sigma^2 = \int_{\vec{k}} PSD(\vec{k}) d\vec{k}.
\f]
